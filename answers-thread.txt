When two threads run concurrently, they may both insert into the same bucket at the same time. 
Thread A reads the current head of the bucket, but before it writes the new element, Thread B 
also reads the same head and writes its own element. When Thread A resumes and writes its new 
element, it overwrites the bucket pointer and loses the element inserted by Thread B. 

This race condition cannot happen with one thread, but with two threads the lost updates 
cause missing keys.
